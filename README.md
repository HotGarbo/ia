# [IA Reader](https://ia.hotgarba.ge)
A stupid-simple reader for [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) books, designed for old web browsers.

## Inspiration
I built this to read things like [Boardwatch](https://ia.hotgarba.ge/#q=boardwatch&free) and [Bartkira](https://ia.hotgarba.ge/read.html#bartkira) on my iPad 2, where Internet Archive's own book reader fails to load, and PDFs and CBRs are frustratingly slow.

Target browser is Safari on iOS 9.3.5. It might work on earlier versions.
